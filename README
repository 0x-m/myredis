Build Your Own Redis
This project is a from-scratch implementation of Redis, built entirely in C/C++ as a learning exercise. The goal is to understand Redis internals by replicating its architecture, data structures, and command processing based on Build Your Own Redis. Through this hands-on approach, I aim to deepen my knowledge of database systems, networking, and efficient memory management.

Features
Fully replicates Redis' core functionality

In-memory key-value storage

Event-driven networking model

Custom-built persistence mechanism

Command-line interface for interaction

Purpose
This project is designed exclusively for educational purposes, providing firsthand experience in building a high-performance database system from the ground up.

Roadmap
Implement all Redis commands

Optimize memory efficiency

Improve performance benchmarks
